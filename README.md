# White Wine Quality Classification (R Implementation)

Assessing wine quality from **physicochemical attributes** is a key task with implications for both consumer satisfaction and industrial decision-making.  
This project implements an **end-to-end binary classification pipeline in R**, covering **EDA**, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Ensemble methods (Bagging, Random Forest, AdaBoost), and **SVMs (Linear / Polynomial / RBF)**.  
Models are evaluated with cross-validation and **.632+ Bootstrap** to ensure robustness.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

- **Name**: White Wine Quality (UCI Machine Learning Repository)  
- **File**: `winequality-white.csv` (semicolon `;` separated)  
- **Target variable recoding**:  
  - `quality.code = 1` (high quality): `quality >= 6`  
  - `quality.code = 0` (low quality): `quality <= 5`
